## Project Name
2025 Project GEOG575_DV_CL

---

### Description
This collaborative project is an interactive geospatial analysis platform developed as part of the GEOG575 course. The project enables users to visualize, explore, and analyze spatial data through dynamic, web-based maps and interactive tools. By integrating multiple datasets and leveraging the Leaflet JavaScript library, the platform facilitates the display of data-driven geographic patterns. Its primary goal is to enhance understanding of spatial relationships.

### Installation & Setup
To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dvanosdall/2025_Project_GEOG575_DV_CL.git
    ```
   -----  or  -----

   Open PowerShell and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/dvanosdall/2025_Project_GEOG575_DV_CL.git
    ```
---

2.  **Setup Extension Project:**
    Install a Live Server extension:
    To view the project in your browser with live reloading, you need to install a Live - Server extension in your preferred code editor.

    For Visual Studio Code:
    Go to the Extensions tab (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
    Search for Live Server and install the extension by Ritwick Dey.
---

3.  **Run Project:**
    Once the Live Server extension is installed, you can open the project folder in your editor.

    Right-click on the index.html file and select Open with Live Server.
    This will open the project in your default web browser and allow you to interact with it.
    Alternatively, you can directly open the index.html file in your browser, but using Live Server is recommended for dynamic updates.

### Final Proposal
**TBD**
### 1. Persona & Scenario  
   - **Persona:**  
     - Description of a prototypical target user.  
     - Includes interests, responsibilities, and expertise levels.  
     - Discusses key needs, goals, objectives, operands, and insights.  
     - Focus on specific tasks and motivations relevant to the project.  

   - **Scenario:**  
     - Walkthrough of a hypothetical user interaction with the interactive map.  
     - Details multiple stages of interaction loops.  
     - Connects functionality (representation designs & interaction operators) to user objectives.  
     - Uses terminology from lectures to describe interaction goals and processes.  

### 2. Requirements Document  
   - **Purpose:**  
     - Accompanies the persona/scenario description.  
     - Mimics an RfP response in an abbreviated table format.  
   
   - **Representation Section:**  
     - Lists each basemap tileset or context overlay as a separate row.  
     - Includes:  
       1. Abbreviated title for the layer.  
       2. Data source description.  
       3. Proposed symbolization details.  

   - **Interaction Section:**  
     - Lists each unique interface widget as a separate row.  
     - Includes:  
       1. Abbreviated function title.  
       2. Categorization by operator and operand (e.g., identify: time).  
       3. Description of interaction behavior and UI design.  

   - **Management:**  
     - The requirements document will guide the project's development.  

### 3. Lo-fi Wireframes  
   - **Purpose:**  
     - Visual representation of the use case scenario.  
     - Demonstrates layout and interaction design.  

   - **Structure:**  
     - A separate wireframe for each new view or interaction.  
     - Draft phase: raw hand-drawn sketches.  
     - Final phase: refined wireframes (ruler for straight edges, color markers for annotations).  

   - **Annotations:**  
     - First wireframe must annotate all interactive functionality.  
     - Uses terminology from the requirements document.  
     - Submitted as high-quality scans.
