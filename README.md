## Project Name
2025 Project GEOG575_DV_CL

---

### Description
**TBD:** The final project proposal is a succinct overview of your design strategy, and is an essential step in your final project progress. The proposal serves three purposes: (1) apply lecture concepts to a real-world project of your design while getting experience responding to CfPs/RfPs (calls/requests for proposals), (2) negotiate expectations of the final project with us to ensure that your project is of sufficient merit and to avoid feature creep, and (3) allot time early in the design process to collaborative outline your conceptual design and team responsibilities before starting coding, ultimately saving you time. The proposal is organized into three sections.

### Class

### Installation & Setup
To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dvanosdall/2025_Project_GEOG575_DV_CL.git
    ```
   -----  or  -----

   Open PowerShell and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/dvanosdall/2025_Project_GEOG575_DV_CL.git
    ```

2.  **Setup Extension Project:**
    Install a Live Server extension:
    To view the project in your browser with live reloading, you need to install a Live - Server extension in your preferred code editor.

    For Visual Studio Code:
    Go to the Extensions tab (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
    Search for Live Server and install the extension by Ritwick Dey.
---

3.  **Run Project:**
    Once the Live Server extension is installed, you can open the project folder in your editor.

    Right-click on the index.html file and select Open with Live Server.
    This will open the project in your default web browser and allow you to interact with it.
    Alternatively, you can directly open the index.html file in your browser, but using Live Server is recommended for dynamic updates.

4. **Contributing**
    Contributors follow these steps:

    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Create a new branch.
    3. Make your changes.
    4. Commit your changes with descriptive messages.
    5. Push your branch to your forked repository.
    7. Submit a pull request.

### Final Proposal
**TBD**
1. Persona/Scenario
The persona should include a description of a prototypical, target user and includes discussion of their interests and responsibilities (e.g., their job description if a professional/scientist; their motivation if part of the general public), with a specific focus on their key needs, expertise levels (across domains and technologies), and motivation. Your description of needs should connect directly to lecture discussion of goals, objectives, operands, and insights: in other words, describe their overarching goals, their primary tasks (objectives+operands), and key insights. You do not need to support all potential goals/tasks/insights, but make clear in your discussion which you believe you need to emphasize in your conceptual design.  The scenario then walks us through a hypothetical interaction session with your proposed interactive map, working through multiple stages of interaction loops. As you describe your scenario, relate the proposed functionality (representation designs and interaction operators) to user objectives using terminology from lecture. Your persona and scenario combined are limited to 1-page, single-spaced in the draft (although may grow beyond this in the final submission given discussion).
---
2. Requirements Document
Your persona/scenario description is accompanied with a requirements document outlining your proposed interactive map functionality. The requirements document mimics an actual response to an RfP, although is abbreviated in table format for the proposal deliverable. The requirements document should be divided according to representation (including data sources) and interaction. For the representation section, include each basemap tileset or context overlay as a separate row in the requirements document, providing: (1) an abbreviated title for the layer, (2) a description of the source, and (3) a description of the proposed symbolization. For the interaction section, include each unique interface widget as a separate row in the requirements document, providing: (1) an abbreviated title for the function, (2) coding by operator and operand (e.g., identify: time; organize functionality by operator), and (3) a description of the proposed interaction behavior and UI design. You will manage your project through the requirements document, so be comprehensive!

3. Lo-fi Wireframes
Finally, provide a series of low-fidelity wireframes that walk through your use case scenario and that demonstrate the layout of your proposed functionality. A separate wireframe must be created for every new view generated in the use case scenario (i.e., for every interaction, or every click). The low-fidelity wireframes should be raw hand-drawn sketches for the draft, but more thoughtfully prepared designs for the final (e.g., use a ruler for straight edges, different colored markers for annotation). Please annotate all interactive functionality in the first wireframe using the terminology from the requirements document. All wireframes should be submitted as high quality scans.
